Project for adding a quote bot to slack.

The end result should be the ability to store and retrieve quotes via a command
to a slack bot:

@bot addquote "some quote here"
@bot showquote
... "some quote here"

The quotes should be stored in a persistent database, and the retrieval of the
quotes from that database should be randomized.

--Setting up the environment--
$ source slackquotebot/bin/activate
$ pip install slackclient

Deactivate the environment 
$ deactivate

Delete the environment
$ deactivate
$ rm -rf slackquotebot
